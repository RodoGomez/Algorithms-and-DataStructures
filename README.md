#** Algorithms and Data Structures. **

## Overall

This repository will be composed of two major sections, one for algorithms and another one for data structures.

## Algorithms

This section will contain a set of different algorithm problems and their solutions written in C, C++ and Python.
The solutions provided in this section will be related to:

* Greedy Algorithm challenges.
* Divide & Conquer algorithm challenges.
* Dynamic Programming challenges.

When required, the challenges will contain **files with the theorical concepts** needed to understand how the algorithm that solves the challenge works.


## Data Structures.

This section will contain the implementation of different data structures used in computer science.
The implementation will be provided in C and C++.
