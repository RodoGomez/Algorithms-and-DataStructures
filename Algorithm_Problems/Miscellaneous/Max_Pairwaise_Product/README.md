# Maximum Pairwise Product

## Problem description:

The problem is about finding the pairwaise that give us the maximum possible product within a given sequence of non-negative integers.

### Input

Two inputs, the first is an integer n that indicates the size of the sequence and the second input is the sequence itself.

### Output

The maximum possible pairwaise product.

### Constraints

2 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 ; 0 ≤ a_{1} , . . . , a_{n} ≤ 2 10^5

## Sample

* Input:

> 3
>
> 1 2 3 

* Output:

> 6
